+ Create an API with 3 endpoints, each with their own controller file and service file. 
    1. Endpoint 1- ask for 2 numbers, Input recieved is 2 numbers, output sum

    2. Endpoint 2- ask for name and time, Input recieved is 2 strings, output strings combined into a sentence

    3. Endpoint 3- ask for 2 numbers, Input recieved is 2 numbers (a and b), output 2 statements (a ><= b, b ><= a)

    4. For numerical equations and inputs use TryParse to validate data

Peer review comments: Very nicely done Avery! I tested each endpoint in Swagger and in Postman and I was able to get the expected results from both platforms, with data validation where necessary. It's interesting how you used HttpGet commands for each of your endpoints. I didn't think of doing it that way but it works perfectly! P.S. AlligatorService and GorL made me laugh. Nice naming conventions!
